---

Naming conventions and code paradigms will be different to the original source code, compatibility with the original
files, bug fixes and updates will take precedence over making a copy of the original engine.

---

This project will **NOT** provide the original game files and is only a tool to create games or run existing games that
were created with either this engine or the original SAGE engine in mind.

If you wish to use this engine to play the original game, you will need to obtain the original game files through the
legal means available, such as through Steam.

---

This project will *probably* be incompatible with the original game in online play, but breaking compatibility will not
be intentional. Any and all compatibility in online play will be a coincidence and may not continue to exist in a future
update.

---

This project **WILL** provide a launcher tool to allow the addition of the original game directory, mods and spin-off
games that may work with this engine.

---

This project has a less restrictive license than the original engine's, allowing for more freedom in the use of the
engine. This is possible thanks to everything being rewritten in a different language and heavily changing the way the
engine works through bug fixes, mechanics updates, etc.
